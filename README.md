# Quicksort Algorithm Analysis

This project includes the implementation and performance analysis of both **Deterministic** and **Randomized** versions of the Quicksort algorithm. The goal is to understand the theoretical and practical aspects of Quicksort and evaluate the effect of randomization on its performance.

## Contents

- `quicksort_analysis.docx`: Detailed report on implementation, time complexity, and empirical performance.
- `quicksort.py`: Python code for running experiments (see below).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib`

Install the required package using:
```bash
pip install matplotlib

# How to run code
python quicksort.py
